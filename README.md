The Weight Tracker app was developed to provide users with a simple, distraction-free way to monitor their weight and stay motivated toward their health goals. The requirements included secure login, daily weight logging, goal setting, and motivational notifications, while the goals were to make the app accessible, reliable, and user friendly. To support these needs, the app incorporated a clean UI with dedicated screens for login, dashboard tracking, a calendar grid view, and charts for progress visualization. User-centered design was emphasized by keeping the layout intuitive, offering responsive scaling for different screen sizes, and minimizing unnecessary features, ensuring that users could quickly log data and view progress without distraction.

The coding process followed best practices such as modularizing features, using Room for efficient data storage, and applying ConstraintLayout for flexible UI design. Testing was conducted on multiple Android versions and devices to confirm functionality, which revealed small UI adjustments and logic fixes that improved overall reliability. Challenges such as implementing motivational notifications required innovative solutions with optional SMS permissions to balance functionality with privacy. Overall, the most successful component was the integration of goal tracking with visual feedback, which demonstrated strong application of both technical coding skills and user-centered design principles.
